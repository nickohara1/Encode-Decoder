# Encode-Decoder

A program that encodes and decodes messages based on what is entered as the cipher. Having the same cipher that the message was encoded in will allow the user to decode the message successfully.

Example:

ENCODING
- Cipher: the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
- Message: this is a secret message
- Result: vkbd bd t duepuv nuddtcu

DECODING
- Cipher: the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
- Message: vkbd bd t duepuv nuddtcu
- Result: this is a secret message
